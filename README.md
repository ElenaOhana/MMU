# MMU
Computer Memory Management Unit 
Each operating system has a Memory Management Unit, based on different page replacement algorithms to operate a virtual memory.
In my project, I implemented 3 of them: FIFO, LRU, MFU algorithms to demonstrate by GUI (SWT libraries) how the replacement works on numbers instead of pages.
The project has another three txt files include json, that are not attached here.
